Design patterns play a crucial role in software development, offering proven solutions to recurring problems encountered during the design and development phases. Their importance stems from several key aspects as reusable solutions, scalability and maintainability, abstraction and encapsulation. 
The topic of our final project was an online pharmacy. Based on this topic, we wanted to show the convenience and speed of this type of ordering medications; design patterns that we successfully implemented in our project provided us with immense assistance in building the application itself. Namely singleton, decorator, factory, observer, adapter and strategy patterns. 
The purpose and objectives of our work was just the same that we wanted to show how design patterns help in the development of any applications, websites and in general make life and work easier for programmers. In our example, we used different patterns that differ in structure for different parts of the code.
